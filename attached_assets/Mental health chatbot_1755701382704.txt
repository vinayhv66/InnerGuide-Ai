Create a detailed plan and design for a chatbot specifically focused on mental health support, with an attractive user interface (UI). The chatbot should primarily engage users by asking about their feelings and provide empathetic, supportive responses aimed at helping users feel normal or better. Importantly, the chatbot should be based on a simple, locally trained model rather than relying on external API calls.

Key requirements:

- Design an engaging and intuitive UI that is welcoming and soothing for users seeking mental health support.
- Develop conversational flows that gently prompt users about their emotions and provide thoughtful, comforting advice or techniques to improve their mood.
- Use a simple machine learning or rule-based model trained locally on a relevant dataset to power the chatbot's responses.
- Avoid any dependencies on external APIs for conversation handling; all processing must be done locally.
- Include suggestions for dataset sources, model architecture, and training methodology suitable for mental health dialogue.
- Address privacy and ethical considerations related to mental health data.

# Steps

1. UI Design: Outline the features of an attractive and calming UI tailored for mental health chat interactions.
2. Dataset Collection: Identify or create datasets containing mental health conversations, feelings expressions, and supportive responses.
3. Model Design: Choose a simple NLP model architecture that can run locally, such as a rule-based system, a small-scale seq2seq model, or intent-recognition with predefined responses.
4. Training Strategy: Detail the training process on the selected dataset, including preprocessing and evaluation with an emphasis on empathetic accuracy.
5. Conversation Flow: Script example dialogues demonstrating how the chatbot asks about feelings and offers support.
6. Deployment: Recommend frameworks and practices for implementing the chatbot UI and integrating the locally running model.
7. Ethical Considerations: Explain how to handle sensitive user data, ensure user privacy, and provide disclaimers about the chatbot not replacing professional help.

# Output Format

Provide a comprehensive, structured proposal document covering all aspects listed above. This document should include UI design concepts, model and training details, example conversations, ethical guidelines, and deployment recommendations. Use clear headings and bullet points for readability.
